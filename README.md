# Babar

## CLI bar charts for node.js

Babar is a simple node.js library to draw bar charts in your console.

![Sample](https://github.com/stephan83/babar/raw/master/img/sample.png)

While it isn't an advanced charting library, it can be useful to get a rought idea of:

* whether some data is random or not
* whether some data is linear, exponential, etc ...

### Features:

* easy to use
* lightweight (~100 lines of code)
* color output
* ASCII output
* automatically bucketizes values (currently only averages values in a bucket)
* MIT license

### Limitations:

* limited options
* only bar charts
* only one data set per graph
* limited accuracy
* only numerical labels
* only linear axes

## Installation

    npm install babar

## Usage

Babar exposes a function whose signature expects at least an array of points, where a point is an array of two values `[x, y]`. It returns a string representation of the data which can be output to your console.

    var babar = require('babar');

    console.log(babar([[0, 1], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 1], [4, 6]]));

While it does its best to render the data automatically, you can also pass along some options.

    var babar = require('babar');

    console.log(babar([[0, 1], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 1], [4, 6]], {
      color: 'green',
      width: 40,
      height: 10,
      color: 'green',
      yFractions: 1
    }));

## Options

* **caption**: specify a caption to display over the bar chart
* **color="cyan"**: specify a color ('yellow', 'cyan', 'white', 'magenta', 'green', 'red', 'grey', 'blue', or 'ascii')
* **width=80**: output will fit in specified width
* **height=15**: output will fit in specified height
* **xFractions**: number of fractions for x labels, does its best by default
* **yFractions**: number of fractions for y labels, does its best by default
